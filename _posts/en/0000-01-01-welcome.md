**POP2OWA** is a small Visual Basic program that allows you to access to an Exchange server through the POP3 protocol, using the Outlook Web Access (OWA) server.

It provides the standard POP interface to your mail client (e.g. Outlook Express, Netscape or Mozilla Mail, Thunderbird, Pegasus). In addition, POP2OWA allows you to send e-mails through OWA service, like a standard SMTP (outgoing mail) server.

POP2OWA is released under the [GPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#GPL) license
