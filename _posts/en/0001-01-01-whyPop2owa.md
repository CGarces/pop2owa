If you have behind a firewall maybe OWA it's the only way to read your mail, because the port used to connect with your Exchange server are closed.

OWA it's a good product but, other users prefer to read the mail off-line, directly from a mail client.

Microsoft offer [RPC over HTTP](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/assistance/HA011402731033.aspx) but it only works in Outlook 2003 with Exchange 2003 Server.

POP2OWA its the better way if you don't like OWA and can't use RPC over HTTP.
